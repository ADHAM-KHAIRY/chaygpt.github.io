        <h2>Welcome to ChayGPT</h2>
        <p class="main-content-text"> Tea was accidentally discovered by Emperor Shen Nong in 2737 BCE and is the second most consumed drink after water. All tea types come from the same plant (Camellia sinensis), and tea bags were invented by mistake. British afternoon tea began in the 1840s, and iced tea became popular at the 1904 World‚Äôs Fair. The oldest tea tree is over 3,200 years old, and the rarest tea, Da-Hong Pao, can cost over $1 million per kilogram. Fun fact: Some teas can even glow under UV light! üçµ‚ú®</p>
