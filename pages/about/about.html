        <h1 class="welcome-message" >WHO ARE WE...</h1>
        <p class="main-content-text"> We are a team of nine passionate Computer Science students from Helwan University, known as one of the best groups in our department. Driven by innovation, teamwork, and a shared love for technology, we constantly push ourselves to create meaningful projects that blend creativity with functionality.
            <br> <br>
            ChayGPT was born as part of our IT project, where we set out to develop a fully functional website for a coffee shop. Our goal is to not only build an intuitive online ordering system but also showcase our skills in web development, design, and collaboration.
            <br> <br>
            With each line of code and every design choice, we aim to deliver a seamless digital experienceâ€”proving that great ideas, strong teamwork, and a passion for tech can turn a simple project into something exceptional.
            <br> <br>
            This is just the beginning, and we canâ€™t wait to see where our journey takes us next!</p>

        <h1 class="welcome-message"> How we meet</h1>
        <p class="main-content-text"> It all started on the first day of university, when Abdelrahman, Adam, and Hamza found themselves sitting next to each other, all equally excitedâ€”and maybe a little nervousâ€”about this new chapter in their lives. A simple conversation about courses and professors quickly turned into laughter, and just like that, the first bonds of our group were formed.
            <br> <br>
            On the second day, Adham and Seif crossed paths. Whether it was fate or just a random seating arrangement, the two instantly clicked, sharing a mutual passion for technology and problem-solving. From that moment, they knew theyâ€™d be working together on something big.
            <br> <br>
            Meanwhile, in a completely different setting, Amir and Hazem met in the metroâ€”a place where countless students cross paths but rarely connect. A casual conversation about assignments and university life led to a lasting friendship that would later play a key role in forming our group.
            <br> <br>
            Back on campus, Hamza met the second Abdelrahman during a section, and the two quickly found common ground, adding another piece to the puzzle of what would become our team.
            <br> <br>
            But if there was one person who unknowingly tied us all together, it was Hazem. He was the common factor in all our sections, introducing different people to each other, connecting the dots, and unknowingly forming the foundation of our team.
            <br> <br>
            Little did we know that these chance meetings would lead to something bigger. As time passed, we realized that we werenâ€™t just classmatesâ€”we were a team. And when the time came to choose an IT project, the decision was clear: we would build something great together.
            <br> <br>
            Thatâ€™s how ChayGPT was bornâ€”not just as a project, but as a reflection of our journey, teamwork, and shared passion for technology.
            <br> <br>
            And this is just the beginning. ðŸš€</p>
